# NeuralNetCode

This Github repository is a part of a project under Professor Kornhauser and Princeton Autonomous Vehicle Research.  
Please visit the main page of the project at https://princetonautonomous.github.io/  

The code is used to train and evaluate a neural network model on virtual driving data from a game GTA V. The model is created in Python using Keras and Tensorflow.  
All detailed information is provided in `CNN_Keras.ipynb`.
